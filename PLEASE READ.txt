    <p>This Project was made by Shiven Shanmugananthan (30) and Joshua Shibu Varghese (33) of Class 9E, Delhi Public School, Nerul.

*The Main Page is "index.html"

*CSS was used to format the files as it made the outcome look better.

*The CSS code has been integrated in each individual file with the <style> and </style> tags.

*We have added a few effects which are:
	1) The crop of the background and the area of the text changes as you resize the window, 
	   and it is always visible no matter the window size.
	2) The hyperlinks have been made to look like buttons.
	3) The buttons change size and colour when hovered upon.
	4) A grey area behind the text is added to give a shadow effect.
	5) The grey area in the Qutub Minar page has a gradient effect.

*It is recommended that the page be viewed in full screen.

*It is recommended that the code be run on a laptop or a desktop.
